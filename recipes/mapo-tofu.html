        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 chili pepper (chili sauce also works as a substitute)</li>
        <li>2 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 green onion (garnish)</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Chicken Marinade</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Texture & Flavor</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tbsp water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="small-header">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken (3 oz) by slicing diagonally.
            Then, gather the clumps of chicken together, and
            chop the pieces into even smaller pieces. Gather,
            flip the clump of chicken, and repeat.</li>
        <li>Place your newly minced chicken in a bowl, and add
            cornstarch (1 tbsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp), and water
            (2 tbsp). Using your hands and a bit of strength, mix
            and massage the chicken around until the marinade is
            fully absorbed. Let the marinade sit for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using your tofu (1 lb) of choice, drain the water from
            packaging, and chop it into cubes.</li>
        <li>Mince your garlic cloves (2), chili peppers (2),
            and green onion (1). Feel free to add more if you want
            more heat. Alternatively, you can use chili sauce instead
            of fresh chilies.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together cornstarch (1 tbsp) and water
            (2 tbsp) until you have an even consistency. We'll be using
            this mix as a thickening agent for the final steps.</li>
        <li>Set your stove to its highest setting, and wait a few
            minutes for your pan or wok to heat up. Once it's hot enough,
            add oil (1 tbsp), garlic cloves (2), and chilies (2). Stir
            the garlic and chilies around for 20 to 30 seconds until you
            can start to smell the aromas. Next, add the chicken to the wok.
            Let it sit for about 20-30 seconds, moving (but not flipping)
            the chicken around.</li>
        <li>Add bean sauce (1 tbsp) to the wok, stirring it around
            with the chicken for about 1 minute. Then, add water (1 cup),
            sugar (1 tsp), salt (1/2 tsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp), and
            dark soy sauce (1/2 tsp). Stir around for a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the tofu (1 lb) to the wok, gently stir it around,
            and cover the wok with a lid. Let it sit for about 3 minutes,
            when the wok starts to boil.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour the cornstarch mix you made earlier into the wok,
            gently stirring the wok around as you go. Be careful not to break
            the tofu in the process. The cornstarch acts like a glue to help
            the tofu trap the flavors. It also acts as a thickening agent,
            giving the dish a more creamy texture. Next add sesame oil (1sp).
            Gently stir the wok around to mix the sesame oil in.</li>
        <li>Finally, to plate the dish, pour the tofu directly into
            a bowl or plate without a spatula. This keeps the tofu intact.</li>
    </ol>
